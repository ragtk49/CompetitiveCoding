 * Leetcode 274. H-Index (https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)
 * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper,
 * return compute the researcher's h-index.
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 * Output: 3

/*
 * Approach:
 * 1. Initialize count array of size n + 1
 * 2. Traverse the array and count the number of papers for each citation count
 * 3. Traverse the count array in reverse and return the first index where the number of papers is greater than or equal to the citation count
 * 4. Return 0
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
